### Example using `up-flags`

Specify flags to pass to the `docker compose up`. Default is none. Can be used
to pass the `--build` flag, for example, if you want persistent volumes to be
deleted as well during cleanup. A full list of flags can be found in the
[docker compose up documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/).
