### Example using `up-flags`

Specify flags to pass to the `docker-compose up`. Default is none. Can be used to pass the `--build` flag, for example, if you want persistent volumes to be deleted as well during cleanup. A full list of flags can be found in the [docker-compose up documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/up/).
